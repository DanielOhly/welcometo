Welcome To

Welcome To is a web bases app that allows you to search throughout Austin for things to do based on personality recommendations.

Search recommendations from local people: Bars, restaurants, local events, family events, museums, you name it.

Angular will be the new technology used for this project.

The MVP for this project is:
•    To navigate through the recommendations available on the page
•    Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of data
•    Create Angular components to display recommendation details and show an array of data
•    Use one-way data binding for read-only data
•    Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks
•    Use routing to navigate among different views and their components

HTML
CSS
Json
